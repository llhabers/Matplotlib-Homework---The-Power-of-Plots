# Matplotlib: Homework-The-Power-of-Plots

Observations and Insights

After reviewing the various graphs from my analysis, I am able to make the following inferences;

Bar Graphs: The drug Capomulin and Ramicane were the top two drugs that were used the most.

Box Plot: Capomulin is more effective for shrinking the tumor volume in mice then the other three drugs. Ramicane was slightly behind the drug Capomulin.

Line of Regression: It seems as though the drugs were less effective on heavier mice. I wonder if there is a similar correlation in humans. Being that the r-value is .84, it is safe to say that this data is reliable.
